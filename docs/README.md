# Agent Resources

This directory contains skills, subagents, and commands that `ttal sync` deploys to your agent runtimes.

## Structure

```
docs/
├── skills/       # Methodology skills (sp-writing-plans, sp-tdd, etc.)
├── agents/       # Subagent definitions (pr-reviewers, task-creator, etc.)
└── commands/     # Slash commands (pr-review, triage, etc.)
```

## How it works

Run `ttal sync` to deploy these to your agent runtime (Claude Code, OpenCode, or Codex):

```bash
ttal sync            # Deploy to runtime
ttal sync --dry-run  # Preview what would be deployed
```

Your `config.toml` `[sync]` section tells ttal where to find these:

```toml
[sync]
  skills_paths = ["./docs/skills"]
  subagents_paths = ["./docs/agents"]
  commands_paths = ["./docs/commands"]
```

## Adding custom skills

Create a new directory in `docs/skills/` with a `SKILL.md` file. See existing skills for the format.
